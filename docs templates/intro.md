# The power of ETH

## Everyone wins

This pool showcases the power of Ethereum.  

- By depositing you are guaranteed to win by supporting a good cause.  
- You have a chance to win in every weeks draw.  
- You don't lose any principal (your original deposit).

## Tokens to participate

get stETH from [Lido](https://stake.lido.fi), [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org), or [1inch](https://app.1inch.io)
<!-- get cbETH -->
 
why no rETH? We would love to have rETH and all LSDs but rETH accumulates yield via price instead of supply.  Supply is easier in this case to turn into prizes.  Any solutions to integrate rETH are welcome!
