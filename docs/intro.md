# The power of ETH

## Everyone wins

This pool showcases the power of Ethereum.  

- By depositing you are guaranteed to win by supporting a good cause.  
- You have a chance to win more ETH in every weeks draw.  
- You don't lose any principal (your original deposit).

It's not a lottery, you save and you win, and nobody loses. 

## How it works?

stETH is a liquid staking token that represents validators securing the Ethereum network.  stETH token increases in supply every 24 hours as yield accrues to validators.  This increase in supply is turned into weekly prize and distributed to lucky winners.  The original depositor balance remains.  The protocol is non-custodial.
